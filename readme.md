# Collection of TSQL and Other Helpful Crap for SQL Server Database

Hi there.

If you found this by accident: this is a complete (incomplete?) work in progress from some aging nerd with aging technology (that is still good for some things) in his basement attempting to stay current with some things while providing
services for one additional human being and three cats in our meager four level dwelling in the Midwest United States. I'm also 1) curious what you were searching for or how you found this and 2) welcome, hope you find something useful.

If you were given this repository by me, hi there. Hopefully you find something here that is usable and might save you time and frustration. Feel free to contribute, laugh at me, buy me a beer or six or just nerd up with me.
